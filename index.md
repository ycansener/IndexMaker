## What is IndexMaker?

It is an almost 10 years old project that I developed in my first year at the University. I found it when I migrate my old files to an external hard drive. Lucky me!

After 10 years, I will refactor this project and upgrade it to the latest technology without breaking it.

### What is in it?

It is a Windows Form Application which built with **.Net Framework 3.5**
Basically it is useful for finding a file in a complex folder. Especially finding a code file might be really hard in a huge project.
I can't say is this app better then Windows Explorer or not, but I can say that after I finish the refactoring, it will be.

### What can you find in this repo?

I will be refactor this complete application step by step.
And I will mark every step with the description of the refactoring.
Then you will be able to see the transformation of a real-life application from the old tech to newest tech.

### What will be the final result?

1. Low Coupling & High Cohesion
2. SOLID Principles
3. Domain Driven Design
4. Most of the part that we can convert will be .Net Core 2.2
5. We may include a brand new Web Project to serve same functionality online.
6. For the all new parts that I will include, I will follow the rules of Test Driven Development.
7. After all I will run this whole project on a Docker Container.
8. I will enjot it!
